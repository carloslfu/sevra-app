# Sevra app

Sevra rethinks the work people do with spreadsheets: gathering messy information,
checking it, calculating, deciding, and explaining. The first audience hypothesis
is a small-business owner reconciling supplier quotes, purchases and inventory.
Mac-first is an implementation choice, not evidence that all such owners use Macs.
The success measure is a completed, explainable job with user-owned evidence.
Token throughput is useful but cannot replace correctness or useful interaction.

The product name is Sevra; Sevra Workbooks is a descriptive offer. This public
repository is `sevra-app` because the separate website business already uses
`sevra`. Website pricing/support does not apply to this app. Slotstream remains
an independent engine and product; this app consumes its public library.

## Reading order

- [[records/specs/product]]: requirements and user experience.
- [[records/specs/storage]]: package, data, transactions, history and calculations.
- [[records/specs/search]]: intake, extraction, indexes, retrieval and scaling.
- [[records/specs/intelligence]]: local model, tools, native generated UI and voice.
- [[records/specs/distribution]]: install, CLI/skill, testing and release contracts.
- [[records/research/foundations]]: primary references and technical findings.
- [[records/reviews/design-passes]]: three explicit adversarial review passes.
- [[records/operations/implementation]]: ordered implementation and acceptance state.

All examples and test data are synthetic. No dependency on the founder's private
brain is required. The product design is adopted from the owner's conversation;
concrete engineering choices are implementer decisions, open to measured revision.
