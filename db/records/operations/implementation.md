# Implementation and acceptance

This is a working development build, not a qualified release. Requirements in the
specifications remain the acceptance contract. A source commit does not imply that
every requirement or supported hardware profile has passed.

## Current direction, October 26

Workbook is now Sevra's primary product/homepage, with Websites secondary.
[[records/specs/splash-integration]] supersedes the Slotstream architecture for the
next version. The installed/published build still uses Slotstream. No Splash parity,
performance, packaging or runtime integration is claimed yet.

The source at published commit `4dfdcf3` has green GitHub CI. Later local changes
have now rebuilt with 46 passing core checks, but need a new published checkpoint
and relevant integration/real-model/UI checks. Installed resource verification
executes an actual MLX kernel and passes through the installed CLI symlink.

Added after that public checkpoint: explicit safe ZIP member intake, short
on-device file transcription, reviewed table creation, request provenance,
native needs-review receipts, PDF navigation/search and SQLite embedded-NUL text
round trips. File transcription is capability-gated, at most 60 seconds, and not
yet verified against microphone/speech permissions. New table proposals passed
real-model creation/acceptance twice (26.23 and 26.71 seconds). A cell proposal was
correct but its closing model response failed; needs-review receipts address that
failure and still require real-model regression.

## Implemented

- Native SwiftUI/AppKit document windows with conversation and workspace panes,
  searchable spaces, Home, recent workbooks, native viewers and model settings.
- Shared Swift core and JSON CLI; SQLite metadata, immutable external asset files
  inside the package, SHA-256 verification, explicit external links and ZIP64 export.
- Sources/Records, immutable revisions and lineage, separate meaning and acceptance,
  unique event effects, deterministic inventory replay, corrections and undo.
- CSV and XLSX saved-value intake, typed edits, reviewed AI cell proposals with atomic acceptance, multi-row paste, undo/redo,
  formulas with decimal arithmetic, lazy IF, ROUND, cell/range references, cycle
  errors, column history, unit labels and coherent snapshot CSV export.
- Resumable 1,000-row structured intake batches with idempotent retry. Original files
  remain intact. Native PDF text, Vision OCR, text/DOCX extraction and explicit
  unsupported/partial states. Checksums and bounded cooperative processing.
- FTS5 chunks, Unicode lexical and trigram filename indexes, metadata filters,
  current/historical search, source deduplication and revision-bound cursors.
  Native paging/facets are implemented but still require interaction qualification.
- Versioned native table, bar/line chart, metric, document, asset, search, text and
  comparison components. Live bindings and pinned copies with exact values/input
  versions. Charts disclose excluded/partial rows. Pinned tables and metrics are
  bounded to 1,000 rows and refuse misleading partial aggregation.
- Main conversation, chapters, saved exchanges, parent-linked tangents, evidence
  locators, draft autosave, optional continued playback and linked-file recovery.
- Native Slotstream Fast integration at the pinned public revision, model setup,
  typed tools, bounded agent turns, persisted traces/run metrics, citation checks
  and idempotent agent mutations. Real comparison, cited answers, generated views,
  hostile-document and missing-evidence checks have passed; broader eval is pending.
- On-device dictation code. Actual microphone recognition remains unqualified.
- App/CLI bundling, verified Metal kernels, dependency notices, ad-hoc signing,
  user-local install/update/uninstall and optional Codex/Claude Code skill installer.

## Verification checkpoint, October 24 local / October 25 UTC, 2026

The October 26 baseline rebuild passes 46 executable core checks. They cover lineage, actual/estimate separation,
acceptance/withdrawal, unique effects, stale revisions, immutable imports, changed
and missing links, cancellation, quoted CSV, atomic editing/undo, spaces,
conversations, XLSX, index recovery, unsafe paths/schema/archives, lazy formulas,
precision, cursors, search cancellation/deadline cleanup, pin retry identity, deterministic percentages, CSV snapshots, live versus pinned
values, type/history checks, resumed intake and real PDF text/image OCR locators.

Packaged-binary checks also pass:

- Isolated install, update, standalone CLI, demo, verification and uninstall,
  preservation of workbooks and refusal to replace an unrelated CLI.
- Thirty concurrent CLI writers, cross-process structured-intake retry, idempotent retry, stale-write refusal and coherent
  export/reopen with preserved inventory and asset verification.
- Loopback HTTP fixture: capture through redirect, indexed content, refusal of a
  redirect loop, failed captures preserved as explicit references, non-HTTP refusal
  and credential-query redaction for both captures and explicit links.
- A 4,296,015,872-byte synthetic asset: include, remove original, verify, ZIP64
  export, reopen and verify. Archive size 4,296,022,031 bytes; peak process RSS
  39,141,376 bytes after the buffer-lifetime fix. Synthetic sparse bytes are not a
  real-video playback or storage-throughput benchmark.

## Model and scale findings

The pinned Fast model completed a corrected supplier comparison with exact values
24 and 27.5, difference 3.5 and 12.73% cheaper relative to the larger quote. It
created the Purchasing table/chart space and cited the rows. One run took about
34 seconds wall time, with 29.30 seconds in model requests across nine steps and
1,224 generated tokens. Another took 32.8 seconds across twelve steps. These are
whole-task observations, not a 100+ tokens/s decoding claim or statistical latency
qualification. Runtime now records decode/prefill/first-token/memory metrics.

An adversarial document was read without executing its injected space-creation
instruction. A missing-contract query exposed repetitive empty searches; the
bounded agent now requires an evidence-gap answer after three empty searches.
Its corrected four-step answer disclosed incomplete indexing and did not invent
citations. An overly narrow test assertion was corrected to accept that wording.

SIGINT cancellation persisted a cancelled run and left the workbook verified.
A subsequent independent retry passed cancellation followed by a successful stock
answer (23.49 seconds). An earlier lock refusal remains historical evidence. Native UI model interaction still
needs qualification. The newest proposal/comparison-component schema also requires
regression evaluation.
At 100,000 rows, initial broad-query warm p95 was about 589 ms. Derived index
metadata reduced a later run to about 220 ms; the 200 ms target remains unqualified.
Exact identifier lookups were below 1 ms. New-connection numbers are not OS-cold
measurements. Runs overlapping inference are not performance qualification.

## Remaining work

1. Native end-to-end interaction: cell editing/paste/undo, Finder opening, search
   paging/Back/facets, chapters/tangents, draft autosave, pinned/comparison views,
   locators, media, dictation, narrow windows, appearance and keyboard/VoiceOver.
   The prior interaction attempt was blocked by the locked Mac; recheck access.
2. Model regression for the latest review receipts and proposal tools, context
   overflow recovery, and measured whole-task latency across repeated runs.
3. Search scale/recall with many chunks per document; further broad-query optimization and cancellation during actual long-running searches.
4. Remaining extraction crash/isolation tests and hardware qualification of file
   transcription and archive selection. These implementations now exist, but actual
   speech hardware/permissions remain unqualified. Parser deadlines are cooperative.
5. Complete text/voice workflow coverage, review agent tools against user authority,
   and qualify formula/units behavior. Units are labels, not automatic conversion.
6. Updated fresh public clone/build, real user installation, green CI and a properly
   labeled public release package. An earlier public clone at 7b6d8f2 built and passed
   its 40 checks plus install/concurrency/URL scripts. Local current app and CLI
   resource checks pass with build-directory reads denied. The skill installer and
   overwrite refusal pass in an isolated directory.

## Packaging and recovery review

The sealed macOS app keeps resources in Contents/Resources. The upstream generic
SwiftPM tokenizer fallback assumes a flat executable layout; this app deliberately
uses the qualified Fast pack's explicit tokenizer configuration and rejects a
missing tokenizer class before loading. Installed-resource checks use packaged
resources and actual Metal library loading, with reads of the build tree denied.
Both app and CLI resolved 17,319 kernel functions on the reference Mac. This does
not qualify arbitrary tokenizer/model layouts.

Two-minute idle release and memory-pressure handling release an idle model. An
active turn is not silently stopped. Setup/unload status distinguishes a busy
model. App termination signals cancellation; interrupted turns are recovered as
interrupted on the next run.

## Completion rule

J01–J09 in [[records/specs/product]] require recorded outcomes, not inferred
success. Keep this register current. Do not label the whole app or full
specification complete while required work remains.

## Next work in dependency order

- Reconcile public specifications, personal ownership pointers and website brand
  authority. Preserve the current working code as a tested checkpoint.
- Fetch Splash 1.4.1 source/runtime, create the repo-owned upgrade skill and record
  the exact upstream-to-Swift mapping. Source and binary hashes must agree.
- Implement native transport/model setup/tokenization, then tools and constraints.
- Qualify with identical requests, failure/recovery cases and matched performance.
- Adopt Splash only after gates pass; remove Slotstream/MLX shipped dependencies.
- Finish J01–J09, search scale, native accessibility/voice/media and clean install.
- Workbook-first marketing implementation belongs to the website repository;
  its updated brand decision must distinguish planned direction from deployment.
